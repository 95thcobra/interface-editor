// Features
//----------------------
Enter button to exit edit mode + esc?
Undo / redo for edit state
Exit edit mode using esc key (undo changes too?)
Send back one, bring forward one, send to back, bring to front (but not in front of edit mode components)
Undo/redo links? - Not sure what I meant 20/12/17
Locking/unlocking widgets (so they can't be interacted with, backgrounds etc.)


// Tidy up
//----------------------
Arrow key movement in edit controller
Expand marquee out to it's own class with inheritance, so you can switch out marquee type/shape etc..


// Improvements
//----------------------
Resize with shift = aspect ratio
Support for multiple attributes on a row e.g https://gyazo.com/fb3f3a596c270d886fe116ac7188cd56 https://gyazo.com/d17ac37a4aee18625f0037c36aba52d5
The way the edit mode outline is refreshed can be improved.
Also widget change listener has room for optimisations as it refresh's multiple times if x/y width/height are changed simultaneously
Advanced arrow key movement system, ideally without a game-loop see : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21331519/how-to-get-smooth-animation-with-keypress-event-in-javaf
Undoing and redoing changing an attribute for multiple widgets in one action rather than splitting into individual actions
