// Improvements
//----------------------
Resize with shift = aspect ratio
Support for multiple attributes on a row e.g https://gyazo.com/fb3f3a596c270d886fe116ac7188cd56 https://gyazo.com/d17ac37a4aee18625f0037c36aba52d5
The way the edit mode outline is refreshed can be improved.
Also widget change listener has room for optimisations as it refresh's multiple times if x/y width/height are changed simultaneously
Advanced arrow key movement system, ideally without a game-loop see : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21331519/how-to-get-smooth-animation-with-keypress-event-in-javaf
Undoing and redoing changing an attribute for multiple widgets in one action rather than splitting into individual actions
Change layout to use mvc?
Custom names for hierarchy items (have name as a WidgetGroup property?) When saving will need a separate *.names file
